# About

Xsct (X11 set color temperature) is a UNIX tool which allows you to set the color
temperature of your screen. It is simpler than [Redshift](https://github.com/jonls/redshift) and [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/).

Original code was published by Ted Unangst in the public domain:
https://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/sct-set-color-temperature

Minor modifications were made in order to get sct to:
- compile on Ubuntu 14.04 and later releases
- iterate over all screens of the default display and change the color
  temperature
- free the Display structure
- fix memleaks
- clean up code
- return `EXIT_SUCCESS`

# Installation

## Make-based

On UNIX-based systems, a convenient method of building this software is using Make.
Since the `Makefile` is simple and portable, both the BSD and [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) variants will have no problems parsing and executing it correctly.

The simplest invocation is
~~~sh
make
~~~
that will use the default values for all flags as provided in the `Makefile`.

Overriding any of the following variables is supported by exporting a variable with the same name and your desired content to the environment:
* `CC`
* `CFLAGS`
* `LDFLAGS`
* `PREFIX`
* `BIN` (the directory into which the resulting binary will be installed)
* `MAN` (the directory into which the man page will be installed)
* `INSTALL` (`install(1)` program used to create directories and copy files)

Both example calls are equivalent and will build the software with the specified compiler and custom compiler flags:
~~~sh
make CC='clang' CFLAGS='-O2 -pipe -g3 -ggdb3' LDFLAGS='-L/very/special/directory -flto'
~~~

~~~sh
export CC='clang'
export CFLAGS='-O2 -pipe -g3 -ggdb3'
export LDFLAGS='-L/very/special/directory -flto'
make
~~~

The software can be installed by running the following command:
~~~sh
make install
~~~

If you prefer a different installation location, override the `PREFIX` variable:
~~~sh
make install PREFIX="${HOME}/xsct-prefix"
~~~

~~~sh
export PREFIX="${HOME}/xsct-prefix"
make install
~~~

## Manual compilation

Compile the code using the following command:
~~~sh
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=c99 -O2 -I /usr/X11R6/include xsct.c -o xsct -L /usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -lXrandr -lm -s
~~~

# Usage

Provided that xsct binary is located in your `$PATH`, execute it using the following command:
~~~sh
xsct 3700
~~~

The first parameter (`3700` above) represents the color temperature.  

If `xsct` is called with parameter 0, the color temperature is set to `6500`.  

If `xsct` is called without parameters, the current display temperature is estimated.

The following options, which can be specified before the optional temperature parameter, are supported:
- `-h`, `--help`: display the help page
- `-v`, `--verbose`: display debugging information
- `-d <delta>`, `--delta <delta>`: shift temperature by the temperature value
- `-s <screen>`, `--screen <screen>` `N`: use the screen specified by given zero-based index
- `-c <crtc>`, `--crtc <crtc>` `N`: use the CRTC specified by given zero-based index

Test xsct using the following command:
~~~sh
xsct 3700 && xsct
~~~
